## 🌟 Introduction

Welcome to the **Selenium Test Automation Framework** for **SauceDemo**! This framework automates functional and UI testing for the SauceDemo website, an e-commerce platform used for test automation practice. The goal is to ensure high-quality and bug-free interactions for end users.

🔧 **Built With:**
- **Selenium** 🐍 - For automating browser actions
- **Python** 🐍 - For scripting and automation logic
- **Pytest** 🐍 - For test execution and reporting
- **Allure** 🌟 - For generating and serving interactive test reports
- **Page Object Model** (POM) 📂 - For scalable and maintainable test scripts

This framework performs automated tests on user workflows such as logging in, adding/removing items to the cart, sorting products, and validating product details.
